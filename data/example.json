B-Reel helped introduce the project to the world with a site that emphasized accessibility and the mobile experience. To ensure the widest possible browser support, we created 5 different sites - a full featured site experience for modern desktop browsers, a full featured site for modern smartphones, a limited site for outdated desktop browsers, a light mobile experience for legacy smart phones, and a bare bones mobile site for old phones with limited capabilities.",
