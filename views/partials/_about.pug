			<p>Hello! I'm a front end developer and visual artist.</p> 
			
			<p>I've been working in the design & tech industry since 2009, when someone took a chance and hired me as a digital artist at an advertising agency in Colorado. They noticed my apparent willingness to fix IE6 bugs and moved me to the tech team where I got to call myself an interactive developer while learning how to code from some incredibly smart and encouraging people.</p>

			<p>After that, I moved to San Francisco for awhile and worked for a small production company and went camping a lot.</p>

			<p>Now I live in New York City where I freelance, draw, make animations, play guitar and fiddle with the knobs on my synths. I also teach interaction design and coding to second year BFA students at <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/parsons/bfa-communication-design/" target="_blank">Parsons School of Design</a>. Please <a href="mailto:suny.gao@gmail.com" target="_blank">email me</a> if you'd like to work on something together :)</p>
